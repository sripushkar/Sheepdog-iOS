# Sheepdog iOS
Sheepdog is an app created to help identify identify selfless young people who serve others. This app is part of an initiative taken by Lambert High School to increase people's involvement in the community, and identify those that have the characteristics of a leader.
As such, the program will include incentives to award these people for serving the community:
..*Create a Sheepdog award for students who exemplify the characteristics of a Sheepdog (heroic acts, helping another student, serving others, etc..) 
..*Promote the Sheepdog of the Year scholarship
..*Sheepdog Scamper & Sprint Road Race
